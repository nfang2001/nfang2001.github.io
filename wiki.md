***The pandemic is finally coming to a closure as many countries around the world are finally fully opened for tourism. Many major international airlines are also resuming flights to many parts of the world. This results in an increase of air travel, and although there were many issues in 2023, it is likely to improve in the upcoming year.***

## Air travel and tourism in 2023

As many countries such as Japan and China have lifted COVID bans, there was a great influx of travel in the summer of 2023. However, as air travel rebounds, there was a great increase in plane ticket prices as there were less tickets in comparison to demand. There were also not enough employees due to many workers being layed off due to the pandemic. In the upcoming year of 2024, it is anticipated to balance the issues along with the surging plane tickets as there would be great increases in planes that are available.
